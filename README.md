I initially built this as a way to learn a framework that has a bunch more built-in tools than a microframework like Flask. Although I have already used Flask for a previous project, I wanted something a bit bigger that would make my life easier while creating a more than basic CRUD application.

I wanted to create a small gradebook application boasting a lot of features I thought would be useful and cool. For example, a bar chart that shows the summary of the grades of a specific class, or maybe a page that displays a lot of relevant, useful information specific to an assignment, while still allowing you to easily grade the assignments of enrollments that have not yet been graded.

In this program, the teacher is able to create all types of assignments (w/ deadlines) and grade it, create announcements, enroll students, etc. In addition, the forms are taken care of: for example, if a teacher wishes to grade a specific assignment of a specific student, the student and the assignment input fields are already selected.
